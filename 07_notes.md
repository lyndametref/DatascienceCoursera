##R<sup>2</sup>

 * **R<sup>2</sup>** is the percentage of the total variability that is explained by the linear relationship with the predictor
 * 0≤R<sup>2</sup>≤1
 * R<sup>2</sup> is the sample correlation squared
 * R<sup>2</sup> can be a misleading summary of model fit.
 * Deleting data can inflate it.
 * Adding terms to a regression model always increases R2.


## Confidence and Prediction Intervals
 * Both intervals have varying widths.
 * Least width at the mean of the Xs.
 * We are quite confident in the regression line, so that interval is very narrow.
 * If we knew β0 and β1 this interval would have zero width.
 * The prediction interval must incorporate the variability in the data around the line.
 * Even if we knew β0 and β1 this interval would still have width.
